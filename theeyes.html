        <p>The Eyesx</p>
         </div>
        <p>Where the eyebrows disappear comes the white and the wet, liquid blue spheres, crystal balls in an old womanâ€™s shelf falling like rain in a blueberry cloud. The eyes suck the light inside, attractions and fade.  In between the eyes and the skin, there is a misty coral line, crumbling with cloudy points, invisible. It creates a shift to what we see as skin and what we believe is more, the eyes as the soul. The lady looks inside your eyes, she barely moves but her orbs stare and sparkle and monochrome bubbles arise, floating inside out, melting or maybe being spun from the inside, the bubbles, the eyes. The filament of gleam that was fastened from the iris to the spectators has a specific orientation. Curved in space. That is the instant connection, reconciliation or armour glass proofed erection of a lady to the others. The eyes of a lady. Blue but they are green. Green now, green but they are green.</p>
