        <p>The Left Hand</p>
         </div>
        <p>A black mole, gliding on the surface of the hand, sets a symmetrical harmony with the previous ones. And here comes the four soldiers, and the stupid stupid thumb always hidden on the side. The phalanges are pale from fear. The torture that could have been performed, or not, by them or to them, left them filled with anomie. Nonetheless, sea lines on the horizon, rising from every finger, halt the sinister atmosphere. The claws, which are nails and snails, attract what ought to be attracted and reject what ought to die. To hurt is to kiss a blue umbrella. The nails of the lady are predators on the breathing belly of an elephant. They make love and they do not look in the eyes. The tension lies in the question of whether they are touching or not touching, of whether the microscopic gap of air is being filled. It could be fairies too, it could be.</p>
