        <p>The Neck</p>
         </div>
        <p>The neck is what connects the soul to the body. Because it makes ends meet, the neck is a pillar, a column from the Erechtheion. It is also very boring, yet very not, yet very boring, but it immediately leads to objects that could be called interesting. An interesting collarbone. An interesting shoulder. An interesting wing of flesh. A wing on the lady’s back to soar. An interesting mole a bit further down, on the chest. An interesting shape. An interesting dress. Covering the interesting shape of the lady’s breasts. The throat of a pigeon lies there too, a cooking recipe. When talking about the neck’s transition to the body, it is important to think about what an apple is and what is an egg. Here, the shoulder is an apple, and it could be a tomato or a potato, but it was never an egg. Just before it started, it died in the shadow, the glare, the contour. Strange light and strange rules.</p>
